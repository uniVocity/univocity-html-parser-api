	/**
	 * Establishes that the matched HTML element should be in the hierarchy of a given element, up to a given limit of
	 * parent nodes to visit. This search depth limit restricts the number of times the parser can go up in the HTML hierarchy
	 * to search for a given element. The first parent node from the current matched element is always at depth limit 1,
	 * the parent's parent is at depth limit 2 and so on. For an example, given this HTML document:
	 *
	 * ```html
	 * <div>
	 *   <article>
	 *     <header>
	 *       <span>first</span>
	 *     </header>
	 *   </article>
	 * </div>
	 * <div>
	 *   <article>
	 *     <span>second</span>
	 *   </article>
	 * </div>
	 * ```
	 *
	 * A technique to get the text of the second `span` element would be:
	 *
	 *
	 * ```java
	 * HtmlEntityList entities = new HtmlEntityList();
	 * HtmlEntitySettings entity = entities.configureEntity("test");
	 * entity.addField("writing")
	 *     .match("span")
	 *         .containedBy("div",2)
	 *     .getText();
	 * ```
	 *
	 * This will only return the text "second" from the last `span`. Its parent is `article` (depth = 1) which in turn is
	 * a child of a `div` (depth = 2).
	 *
	 * The first `span` element is ignored as it is contained by a `div` located 3 levels up in the hierarchy.
	 *
	 * @param elementName the name of the element that should contain the current matched HTML element in its hierarchy.
	 *                    **Note:**This finalizes the filtering rules applied over the current matched element.
	 *                    Additional filtering rules will take effect over this new element.
	 * @param depthLimit  the limit of how far the parser will search from the currently matched element into its parent nodes
	 *                    until the given element is found.
	 *

	 *

	 * `<li class="lvprice prc">` will be matched.
